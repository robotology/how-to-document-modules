## Introduction

This template repository provides a detailed guide on how your modules, and possibly their API you exposed as _IDL services_, should be documented.

A clean and handy way to deal with your documentation is to exploit the [**GitHub Pages**](https://pages.github.com/), which represents a nice tool to publish software documentation online.

Everything is basically done through the special branch called **`gh-pages`**. The branch must contain at the root level the **index.html** file pointing to the static documentation (generally generated via [**doxygen**](http://www.doxygen.org)) stored somewhere within the branch itself. Further, the static documentation might be composed of many products (sometimes images), thus it would be worth saving space on the repository by not retaining any history for those files.

First off, we explain how to **create the infrastructure** for the documentation using _git_ and keep it **up-to-date** throughout the changes the code undergoes. Then, we will dig into how we can use **doxygen** to generate the documentation.

Let's start :sparkles:

### Creating the infrastructure

From `master`, create a new branch called `gh-pages` on your repository. Then, locally do:

```sh
git checkout master
git fetch origin
git branch gh-pages --track origin/gh-pages
git checkout gh-pages
```
Now you have the same branch `gh-pages` also on your machine which tracks the _remote_ `gh-pages`.

Next step is to create the **static documentation locally**:
- Provide thus a **sub-directory** called **`doxygen`** where you have to put the file **`generate.txt`** that tells doxygen how to produce the documentation.
You can find a template `generate.txt` file [here](https://github.com/robotology/how-to-document-modules/blob/gh-pages/doxygen/generate.txt) within this repository.

    Inside the `generate.txt` file, the most important parameter you are required to fill in is **`INPUT`**, which specifies the directories containing your code to be documented (a recursive search is typically done). An example follows:
    ```
    INPUT = ../src \
            ../idl_dox \
            generated-from-xml
    ```
    Typically, to be neat, the file `generate.txt` contains instructions to generate the documentation under **doxygen/doc** via the parameter **`OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`**.

    To find out more about other doxygen parameters, we suggest you to look directly at the online guide.

- Now type:
```sh
cd doxygen
doxygen ./generate.txt
 ```
 This will generate your documentation. The new directory **doxygen/doc** will appear containing all your documentation.

- Create the `index.html` file at the root level of your repository that provides the entry point to your documentation. This is an [**example**](https://github.com/robotology/how-to-document-modules/blob/gh-pages/index.html) you have to tailor to your specific repository.

- Stage, commit and push:
```sh
git add ./doxygen
git add ./index.html
git commit -m "provided doxygen documentation"
git push origin gh-pages
```

After publishing the changes, you can visit the page https://robotology.github.io/how-to-document-modules (of course use your github account and repository name in the url) and you will be redirected to the online documentation.

Finally, it is also a good practice to cite that url from within the `README.md` file.

### Updating the documentation

By creation, the special `gh-pages` branch should always mirror the `master` branch and should contain two things more: the doxygen directory along with the `index.html` file. Regarding the commit history, `gh-pages` should be always [one commit ahead of `master`](https://github.com/robotology/how-to-document-modules/network).

Whenever you update `master` branch then, do the following to update the documentation accordingly:
```sh
git checkout gh-pages
git rebase master
cd doxygen
rm -rf ./doc
doxygen ./generate.txt
git add ./doc
git log -1
git commit --amend
git push --force-with-lease
git checkout master
```

The **`git log -1`** command serves as verification and does display the very last commit message on the `gh-pages` branch, which must be "*provided doxygen documentation*", that is the one specified initially at creation time. The combination of **`git commit --amend`** and **`git push --force-with-lease`** aim to modify the latest stored commit instead of creating a brand new one and eventually force publishing it. This way, we always retain only one commit for the documentation instead of dealing with its whole history.

### :octocat: Automatic documentation (a.k.a. let GitHub do the job for us!)

All the steps we have covered so far can be conveniently improved and automatized using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

To do so, just drop the file [.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml](.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml) in your repository, keeping the path unchanged.

Finally, copy out this badge within your main README.md file.

### How to write the documentation

You have to provide the documentation of your module through an _xml file_:

- [**modulename.xml**](https://github.com/robotology/how-to-document-modules/blob/master/how-to-document-modules.xml) for the general description.

Moreover, if your module also exposes an IDL generated API, then the corresponding services should be documented in the relative _thrift file_:

- [**idl.thrift**](https://github.com/robotology/how-to-document-modules/blob/master/src/idl.thrift) listing and documenting all the available services.

We don't go here into more details since at the following links you'll find official guidelines on how to write the documentation for:
- [xml description of your module](http://wiki.icub.org/brain/xml_module_documentation.html).
- [Thrift services](http://www.yarp.it/thrift_tutorial_simple.html).

Of course, aside from the documentation generated automatically from the code, you should also fill the `README.md` file with information about **installation instructions**, **dependencies**, so as descriptions regarding the **goal of your module**, the **theory behind your implementation**, **tutorials** to make the learning curve of your software more gentle, and everything is necessary to help the user :smile:.

#### Documentation generated from xml

The xml file containing the general description of the modules cannot be automatically digested by doxygen, requiring first a conversion into the dox language by means of a style sheet parser shipped with Yarp. To this end, you can profitably rely on scripts we made for you, which automate this operation:
- [doc-compile.sh](https://github.com/robotology/how-to-document-modules/blob/gh-pages/doxygen/doc-compile.sh): a bash script for Linux.
- [doc-compile.ps1](https://github.com/robotology/how-to-document-modules/blob/gh-pages/doxygen/doc-compile.ps1): a powershell script for Windows.

Dependencies to run these scripts are:
- [**doxygen**](http://www.doxygen.org), of course :smile:
- [**xsltproc**](http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/InstallingAProcessor.html), on Linux you can get it via `sudo apt-get install xsltproc`.
- **`YARP_SOURCE_DIR`** environment variable set (but you can customize the scripts as you like)

These scripts need to be located within the doxygen directory. When run, they replace the `rm -rf ./doc` and `doxygen ./generate.txt` instructions in the flow above by applying style sheet conversion and then producing documentation in one go. The final products will be then put under the **doxygen/generated-from-xml** directory. Therefore, doxygen must be aware of the latter path when collecting all the files we want to document. For this reason, this path is declared in the **`INPUT`** section of the `generate.txt` file.

#### Why do we also specify the **idl_dox** directory as further input?

This directory is necessary only if you provide Thrift services using the `yarp_add_idl` cmake directive. In this case, the header file **modulename_IDL.h** (or any equivalent name according to your setting) will be generated automatically inside the **build**, which is generally ignored by doxygen in its search. Thereby, as **temporary workaround solution**, we suggest to `copy and paste` the header file from the build into the **idl_dox** stub and make doxygen aware of its presence by filling the **`INPUT`** parameter.
